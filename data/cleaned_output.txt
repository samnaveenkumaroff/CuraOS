ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
N47.1 PHIMOSIS
Option of steroid cream vs. Circumcision discussed
Circumcision is removal of entire foreskin.  I have explained this clearly with demonstration of either
diagram, self-drawn picture, or on pt's own penis at about 5th grade level so that it is clearly understood.
Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery were discussed in detail with the patient. These include, but
are not limited to, bleeding, infection; anesthetic complications- DVT, PE, MI, and even death; injury to
surrounding organs, including injury to the GU tract. The risk of perceived shortening of the penis, increased
sensitivity, numbness, scarring, pain, and skin bridges were discussed specifically for circumcision surgery.
Possibility of reoperation was also discussed with the pt.
There is extensive variability in the appearance of mens genitals and there is NO guarantee that he will be
satisfied with the appearance. There can be variability in how loose or tight the shaft skin will be after
circumcision and there is some subjectivity with regard to what is desirable. I can not guarantee he will be
happy with this. With the glans more exposed, there may be changes in the sensitivity which may alter

sexual function to some extent. Patient also know that the procedure will NOT lengthen the penis and will
NOT enhance erectile function
Informed consent was obtained after the pt's questions were answered.
Adequate time was given to patient to ask questions and all questions were answered.
Pt expressed understanding.
Pt at this time elects for trial of betamethasone cream x 6 weeks If fail,
he will elect for circumcision as discussed above
